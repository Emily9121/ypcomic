YayPonies Comics Toolkit 1.0
-------------------------------------
YP tools are provided as it is, there might or might not
be a README, we warranty absolutely nothing, it does work for us.
-------------------------------------

What it does :
It create PDF and CBZ files from the images files available in the extracted epubs.
---

How it work :
When you launch ComicsToolKit.bat, it will ask multiple question. images file 
(cover.jpeg, img_002.jpeg,...) should be put in the work folder before, also check if
002.jpg and pdf.png is present !

---

What you need to know before launching it :

It will ask for filename, for both PDF and CBZ, under YayPonies standard, filename are :
YP-FORMAT-SERIESCOMIC00.format, exemple, Friends forever 9 will be YP-PDF-FFCOMIC09.pdf
and YP-CBZ-FFCOMIC09.cbz - and main series 23 will be YP-PDF-COMIC23.pdf and YP-CBZ-COMIC23.cbz

It will ask you to list filename, PDF can't autodetect files to include, if you look to
filename list.txt, you'll see a list ready to be copy/pasted, if there is 25 pages, then
with pdf.png, there will be 26 pages, so you will need, when asked, to copy/paste from that list:
"work\001.jpg work\pdf.png work\003.jpg work\004.jpg work\005.jpg work\006.jpg work\007.jpg work\008.jpg work\009.jpg work\010.jpg work\011.jpg work\012.jpg work\013.jpg work\014.jpg work\015.jpg work\016.jpg work\017.jpg work\018.jpg work\019.jpg work\020.jpg work\021.jpg work\022.jpg work\023.jpg work\024.jpg work\025.jpg work\026.jpg"
If there is 4 pages, so 5 with pdf.png, you'll need to copy/paste "work\001.jpg work\pdf.png work\003.jpg work\004.jpg work\005.jpg"

It will ask you for the title and authors of the comic, YOU NEED TO WRITE THEM BETWEEN " "
Typing : "My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic #23" : is correct
Typing : My Little Pony, Friendship is Magic #23 : is INCORRECT !!!
